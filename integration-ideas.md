# WinTiler Integration and Feature Ideas

This document lists potential integrations and new features for WinTiler to enhance its functionality and user experience.

## 1. Advanced Layout Management

### Custom Layout Editor
- **Idea:** Implement a graphical editor that allows users to create their own tiling layouts by splitting the screen into custom zones, similar to Microsoft PowerToys' FancyZones.
- **Benefits:** This would provide a much more flexible and user-friendly way to define tiling layouts compared to the current fixed grid.

### Layout Profiles
- **Idea:** Allow users to save and load different layout profiles. For example, a user could have a "Coding" profile with a specific layout for their IDE and terminal, and a "Web Browsing" profile with a different layout.
- **Benefits:** Users could quickly switch between different window arrangements depending on their current task.

## 2. Configuration and Customization

### External Configuration File
- **Idea:** Move hardcoded settings (like the grid size `FullScreen.NUM_OF_BOXES`) and keyboard shortcuts into a user-editable configuration file (e.g., in JSON or XML format).
- **Benefits:** This would allow users to customize WinTiler to their needs without having to modify the source code and recompile the application.

### Gaps Between Windows
- **Idea:** Add an option to create small gaps between tiled windows.
- **Benefits:** This is a popular cosmetic feature in many tiling window managers that can improve the visual separation of windows.

## 3. Application-Specific Rules

### Per-Application Layouts
- **Idea:** Allow users to define rules that apply specific layouts to certain applications. For example, a rule could specify that Visual Studio should always open in the left half of the screen.
- **Implementation:** This would involve identifying windows by their process name (e.g., `devenv.exe`), window title, or window class.
- **Benefits:** This would automate the process of arranging windows for common tasks.

### Floating Windows
- **Idea:** Allow users to specify certain applications (or types of windows, like dialog boxes) that should be ignored by the tiler and always float on top of other windows.
- **Benefits:** This is essential for applications that are not well-suited for tiling, such as GIMP with its multiple tool windows.

## 4. Multi-Monitor Support

- **Idea:** Extend WinTiler to support multiple monitors. Users should be able to:
    - Move windows between monitors using keyboard shortcuts.
    - Have different tiling layouts on each monitor.
- **Benefits:** This is a critical feature for users with multi-monitor setups, which are common among developers and power users.

## 5. Exposing an API or CLI

- **Idea:** Expose a simple API (e.g., via named pipes or a local socket) or a command-line interface (CLI) to allow other applications to interact with WinTiler.
- **Example Use Cases:**
    - An AutoHotkey script could use the CLI to apply a specific layout.
    - A Stream Deck plugin could use the API to provide physical buttons for window management.
- **Benefits:** This would open up WinTiler to a wide range of integrations with other tools and workflows.
